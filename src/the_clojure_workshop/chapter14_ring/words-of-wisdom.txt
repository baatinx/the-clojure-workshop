1. An important distinction to make between PUT and POST is that PUT should be used
when updating an existing resource or when we happen to know the unique ID of the
entity we're creating. POST is used solely for the creation of resources and does not
require us to know its unique ID. Instead, this ID will be allocated by the web service
itself and communicated back to the client via the response headers.
The full set of supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD,
PATCH, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. The first four of which are most
typically encountered.

2. JSON to EDN conversion leads to a loss of data. This is due to EDN having more built-in type
support than JSON (for example, sets and keywords)
