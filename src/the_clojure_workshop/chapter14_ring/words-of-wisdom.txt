1. An important distinction to make between PUT and POST is that PUT should be used
when updating an existing resource or when we happen to know the unique ID of the
entity we're creating. POST is used solely for the creation of resources and does not

The full set of supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD,
PATCH, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. The first four of which are most
typically encountered.
